Notes:
- All programs are standard C and tested on Linux.
- Output screenshots are included for each task.

How to compile and run the code:

For each task (replace taskX.c with the file you want):

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Compile:
   gcc task1.c -o task1
   gcc task2.c -o task2
   gcc task3.c -o task3
   gcc task4.c -o task4
   gcc twm.c -o twm
   gcc kwms.c -o kwms
3. Run:
   ./task1
   ./task2
   ./task3
   ./task4
   ./twm
   ./kwms

For task4 (external sort):
- Make sure employee.dat exists and contains unsorted employee records before running task4.
- The program will display the file before and after sorting.
